<!-- 
Things to notice in the example above:
**The ng-controller directive is used to (implicitly) create a scope for our template, and the scope is augmented (managed) by the SpicyController Controller.
**SpicyController is just a plain JavaScript function. As an (optional) naming convention the name starts with capital letter and ends with "Controller".
**Assigning a property to $scope creates or updates the model.
**Controller methods can be created through direct assignment to scope (see the chiliSpicy method)
**The Controller methods and properties are available in the template (for both the <div> element and its children).
